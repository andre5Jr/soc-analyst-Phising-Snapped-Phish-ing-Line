📝 Project Title:
TryHackMe – Snapped Phishing Line: Analyzing a Real-World Phishing Kit and Credential Harvesting Campaign

🎯 Objective:
Investigate a credential harvesting phishing campaign by tracing email artifacts, redirection URLs, and phishing kit archives. Analyze logs, domain records, and archive submissions to track adversary infrastructure, discover attacker email addresses, and extract IOCs from the deployed phishing kit.

🛠️ Tools Used:

VirusTotal
SSL Certificate Transparency Logs
Phishing Kit File Analysis
Open-source Intelligence (OSINT)
TryHackMe virtual environment
Hashing tools (SHA256)
Defanged URL analysis

❌ Skills Demonstrated:

Real-world phishing infrastructure investigation
Phishing kit reverse engineering
SSL certificate and archive submission timeline analysis
IOC (Indicator of Compromise) extraction
Email and credential collection path tracing
Project Overview
This investigation revolved around a phishing attack targeting a specific user with a PDF attachment. The adversary used redirection techniques and hosted a phishing kit archive to harvest credentials. The goal was to reconstruct the attack chain, from email delivery and redirection, to phishing page behavior, and finally to adversary infrastructure including credential collection endpoints.

Task Breakdown
✏️ Task 1: Identify the Target
Objective: Who is the individual who received an email attachment containing a PDF?
Method: Inspect the provided email logs or metadata to locate the targeted recipient.

✏️ Task 2: Sender Address
Objective: What email address was used by the adversary to send the phishing emails?
Method: Analyze the "From" or "Return-Path" in the phishing email headers.

✏️ Task 3: Redirection URL for Zoe Duncan
Objective: What is the redirection URL to the phishing page for the individual Zoe Duncan? (defanged format)
Method: Follow redirection chains from email or PDF link artifacts in a defanged format (e.g., hxxp://).

✏️ Task 4: Phishing Kit Download Location
Objective: What is the URL to the .zip archive of the phishing kit? (defanged format)
Method: Inspect the infrastructure used to host the phishing kit and retrieve the archive URL.

✏️ Task 5: Phishing Kit Hash
Objective: What is the SHA256 hash of the phishing kit archive?
Method: Use VirusTotal or a local hashing tool to extract the SHA256 value.

✏️ Task 6: Archive Submission Time
Objective: When was the phishing kit archive first submitted? (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC)
Method: Check VirusTotal’s “First Submission” timestamp on the archive file.

✏️ Task 7: SSL Certificate Logging Time
Objective: When was the SSL certificate the phishing domain used to host the phishing kit archive first logged? (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
Method: Query SSL certificate transparency logs using tools like crt.sh.

✏️ Task 8: Victim Who Submitted Password Twice
Objective: What was the email address of the user who submitted their password twice?
Method: Analyze the logs or phishing kit credentials dump for duplicate entries.

✏️ Task 9: Credential Collection Email
Objective: What was the email address used by the adversary to collect compromised credentials?
Method: Extract email address used as a collection endpoint in the phishing kit's backend code.

✏️ Task 10: Additional Gmail Account
Objective: The adversary used other email addresses in the obtained phishing kit. What is the email address that ends in "@gmail.com"?
Method: Analyze the phishing kit source files for additional email strings.

✏️ Task 11: Final Hidden Flag
Objective: What is the hidden flag?
Method: Search through phishing kit metadata, source code, or embedded comments for flag syntax.

🔍 Analysis and Reflection

💡 Challenges Faced:

Following URL redirection paths through multiple layers
Extracting precise timestamps from VirusTotal and SSL certs
Parsing email addresses from phishing kit source code

💡 Lessons Learned:

Adversaries often reuse email addresses across phishing kits
Certificate transparency can aid in infrastructure detection
A single phishing archive can reveal the entire attack pipeline

💡 Relevance to SOC Analyst Roles:

Enhances skills in identifying and dissecting phishing kits
Reinforces understanding of phishing infrastructure timelines
Builds experience in analyzing stolen credential flows

💡 Relevance to Penetration Testing / Red Teaming:

Demonstrates how attackers structure phishing campaigns
Offers insight into evasion techniques and infrastructure reuse
Shows how simple ZIP kits can cause real-world breaches

✅ Conclusion

💡 Summary: This lab traced a phishing campaign from a deceptive email to credential collection using a ZIP-delivered phishing kit. By uncovering redirection links, SSL cert logs, and adversary-controlled email addresses, I extracted valuable IOCs and revealed attacker infrastructure. This room added real-world threat hunting depth beyond email headers — focusing on phishing infrastructure and archive analysis.

💡 Skills Gained:

URL redirection and phishing kit analysis
SSL certificate timeline investigation
Hashing and credential flow tracing
IOC extraction for threat intel use

💡 Next Steps:

Automate phishing kit analysis using custom scripts
Create Sigma rules to detect .zip archive delivery via email
Track certificate reuse across similar phishing domains
